# MetaMask Snap Playground

I'm using this repository to play around with the new [MetaMask snap](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html#what-is-snaps) feature.

## Requirements

1. [MetaMask Flask](https://metamask.io/flask/) (make sure you don't have MM Flask installed along side vanilla MM in the same browser)
2. Node

## Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/TtheBC01/MetaMask-Snap-Example.git
cd MetaMask-Snap-Example
yarn install
yarn build
yarn serve
```
